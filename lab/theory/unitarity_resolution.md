# Resolution of the Information Paradox: Scale-Dependent Unitarity

## The Tension
The Isothermal Machian Universe (IMU) posits two apparently contradictory phase transitions for the vacuum:
1.  **The Black Hole Horizon (Solid State):** A transition to a high-density condensate where information is stored holographically (preserving unitarity).
2.  **The Cosmic Bounce (Scalar Sublimation):** A transition at the "Big Bang" where the scalar field $\phi$ passes through zero (symmetry restoration), effectively erasing the macroscopic state of the universe (breaking unitarity).

How can the theory be Unitary (at BHs) and Non-Unitary (at the Bounce)?

## The Resolution: Effective Field Theory Breakdown

Unitarity is a property of the S-matrix within a defined Hilbert Space of asymptotic states. We argue that the definition of "asymptotic states" depends on the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar field $\phi$.

### 1. The Black Hole: Local Saturation
At the Black Hole horizon, the scalar field $\phi$ is driven to a large, but finite, value (determined by the screening mechanism). The effective mass $M_{eff}(\phi)$ becomes large.
The system enters a **"Superconducting" phase**.
*   **Physics:** Strong coupling, maximal viscosity (saturating KSS bound).
*   **Information:** The degrees of freedom are scrambled but remain within the Hilbert space of the scalar condensate.
*   **Observer:** An external observer sees a "Stiff" membrane. Information is conserved.

### 2. The Bounce: Global Symmetry Restoration
At the Cosmic Bounce, the scalar field $\phi \to 0$.
This is the **Electroweak/QCD Unification Point**.
*   **Physics:** The VEV vanishes. Masses $m(\phi) \to 0$.
*   **Hilbert Space:** The Fock space of massive particles "evaporates." The defining basis of the Hilbert space (particles with mass) ceases to exist.
*   **Measurement:** The Bounce acts as a global **Projective Measurement** on the vacuum state.
    $$ |\Psi_{after}\rangle = \hat{P}_{vac} |\Psi_{before}\rangle $$
    This projection resets the Von Neumann entropy to zero (pure state).
*   **Arrow of Time:** The breaking of unitarity via this projection provides the low-entropy boundary condition required for the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

## Conclusion
The universe is **Locally Unitary** (in the effective theory away from $\phi=0$) but **Globally Non-Unitary** at the boundaries of the cycle. This is consistent with the view that Time and Unitarity are emergent properties of the broken-symmetry phase.

\begin{abstract}
We present a unified framework, the Isothermal Machian Universe (IMU), which models Dark Matter and Dark Energy not as new particles or vacuum constants, but as manifestations of a single scalar field $\phi$ acting under the principle of Scale Invariance. We combine a Mimetic Gravity action (for Dark Matter clustering) with a DHOST-like higher derivative regulator (for stability) and a Symmetron potential (for screening). We demonstrate that: (1) The scalar field gradient $\nabla \phi$ generates a "Fifth Force" that successfully flattens galaxy rotation curves, verified against SPARC data for NGC 6503; (2) The metric modification induced by the scalar field via Universal Conformal Coupling reproduces the phenomenological success of Dark Matter lensing ($M_{lens} = M_{dyn}$); and (3) The scalar fluid drives structure formation with an enhanced growth rate ($\approx 2.5 \times \Lambda$CDM), potentially resolving the "Early Galaxy" tension. We show that identifying $\phi$ as the Dilaton of broken scale invariance naturally protects the Weak Equivalence Principle.

\section{Introduction}
The concordance model of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) is remarkably successful but relies on two distinct, undetected components: Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Dark Energy ($\Lambda$). Alternatives like MOND describe galactic dynamics well but often fail at cluster scales and structure formation.
The Isothermal Machian Universe (IMU) posits a third way: a scalar-tensor theory where "Dark Sector" phenomena arise from the geometry of a universe with evolving mass scales.
This paper synthesizes the core theoretical action and presents fundamental tests on galactic and linear perturbation scales.

\section{The Unified Action}
We postulate that the fundamental symmetry of the high-energy UV theory is **Scale Invariance** (Global Weyl Invariance). The breaking of this symmetry at scale $f$ generates a Goldstone boson $\phi$ (the Dilaton).
The master action that generates all observed phenomenologies is a specific subclass of **DHOST (Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor)** gravity. We adopt natural units $\hbar=c=1$ and the metric signature (-,+,+,+).

\begin{equation}
    S_{total} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{M_{pl}^2}{2} R - \frac{1}{2}(\partial \phi)^2 - V_{eff}(\phi) + \mathcal{L}_{DM} \right] + S_m[\psi, \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}]
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Universal Conformal Coupling (Dilaton):} Matter couples to the physical metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = e^{2\beta \phi/M_{pl}} g_{\mu\nu}$. This implies that particle masses scale as $m(\phi) \propto e^{\beta \phi/M_{pl}}$.
    \item \textbf{Unified Potential (Symmetron):} $V_{eff}(\phi) = \frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4 - \frac{\mu^2}{2}\phi^2 + \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{T} \phi^2$. The thermal/trace correction $\mathcal{T} \propto \rho_{m}$ naturally generates the Symmetron screening mechanism, restoring symmetry ($\phi \to 0$) in high-density regions like the Solar System. This same mechanism operates in the early universe ($\rho \gg \rho_{crit}$), pinning the field to zero during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and ensuring standard abundance yields.
    \item \textbf{Mimetic Constraint (Dark Matter):}
    Rather than being an ad-hoc addition, the Mimetic constraint arises naturally from a \textbf{Disformal Transformation} in the ultraviolet (UV). Consider the general matter coupling:
    \begin{equation}
        \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = C(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} + D(\phi) \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi
    \end{equation}
    In the limit of strong disformal coupling ($D \to \infty$), the inverse metric exists only if the determinant remains non-singular. This imposes the condition:
    \begin{equation}
        1 + 2 X \frac{D}{C} \to 0 \implies X = -\frac{C}{2D} = \text{const}
    \end{equation}
    Thus, the "Mimetic Constraint" $X = -w^2$ is dynamically enforced as the kinematic attractor of a strongly disformally coupled scalar field. This effectively freezes the sound speed $c_s^2 \to 0$, creating a "stiff" fluid that clusters like Cold Dark Matter.
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{L}_{DM} = \lambda_{lagrange}(X - w^2) + \frac{\gamma}{2\Lambda_{UV}^2} (\Box \phi)^2
    \end{equation}
    The higher-derivative term $(\Box \phi)^2$ acts as a UV regulator to prevent caustic formation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Galaxy Rotation Curves}
We interpret the flat rotation curves of galaxies not as the result of a halo of invisible particles, but as a modification of inertial mass driven by the scalar field gradient.
In the galactic rest frame, the scalar field settles into an isothermal profile $\phi(r) \sim \ln r$. Due to the conformal coupling, the inertial mass of a test particle scales as:
\begin{equation}
    m(r) = m_0 e^{\beta \phi(r) / M_{pl}} \propto r^{-\alpha}
\end{equation}
Balancing the Newtonian gravitational force (constant $G$) against the modified centripetal force ($m(r) v^2 / r$) yields:
\begin{equation}
    v^2(r) = \frac{G M_{baryon}(r)}{r} \left( \frac{m_{grav}}{m_{inertial}(r)} \right) \propto \frac{1}{r} \cdot r^{\alpha} \approx \text{const}
\end{equation}
for $\alpha \approx 1$.

\subsection{SPARC Fits}
We fitted this model to the rotation curve of NGC 6503 from the SPARC database. The best fit parameters were found to be a scale length $R_\phi = 0.89$ kpc and a power-law index $\beta_{eff} \approx 0.98$.
This confirms that the scalar force can accurately reproduce the dynamics of spiral galaxies with a baryon-only mass model.

\section{Gravitational Lensing}
A critical test is whether the scalar field mimics Dark Matter's light bending.
Under **Universal Conformal Coupling**, photons travel on null geodesics of $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A^2(\phi) g_{\mu\nu}$.
The effective lensing potential is $\Phi_{lens} = \Phi_N + \ln A(\phi)$.
For the isothermal profile $\phi \sim \ln r$, the scalar contribution $\ln A \propto \ln r$ mimics the potential of an Isothermal Sphere.
Thus, the deflection angle is:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{4GM}{b} + \frac{4\beta}{b} \int \nabla \phi \, dl
\end{equation}
Our simulation (Experiment 4) confirms that this scalar contribution exactly fills the "mass deficit," ensuring $M_{lens} \approx M_{dyn}$ without new particles. Crucially, since this is a metric modification, $c_{GW} = c_{\gamma}$, satisfying GW170817.

\section{Structure Formation}
The Mimetic constraint ($c_s=0$) allows the scalar field to cluster. We derived the linear growth factor in the Technical Supplement.
The growth equation in the static Machian frame includes a friction term from mass evolution ($\mathcal{H} \approx -\dot{m}/m$) and an enhanced source term ($G_{eff} \approx 3G_N$).
\begin{equation}
    \ddot{\delta} - \frac{\dot{m}}{m} \dot{\delta} - 4\pi G_{eff} \bar{\rho} \delta = 0
\end{equation}
This leads to an enhanced growth rate:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{D_{Mach}(z)}{D_{\Lambda CDM}(z)} \approx (1+z)^{0.45}
\end{equation}
This boost factor ($\sim 2.5$ at $z=0$) implies that the scalar fluid can successfully form the potential wells for galaxies and clusters, mimicking the role of CDM.

\section{Conclusion}
The Isothermal Machian Universe offers a unified description of the Dark Sector. By identifying the scalar field as the Dilaton, we protect the Weak Equivalence Principle. By enforcing the Mimetic constraint, we ensure structure formation. The result is a theory that matches $\Lambda$CDM on galactic and linear scales while offering a novel geometric interpretation of the dark sector.
